- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lexinoelhorvath
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything I can get my grubby little hands on. Today, basic coding, websites. Tomorrow, building an archive of material from the local DIY music scene. The day after that, who knows. Maybe I'll get back into cooking. Or finally be able to get a cat.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something, I hope.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Don't! Yet.
